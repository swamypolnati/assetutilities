## Questions

**Engineering Principles**

- What is motivation to do engineering?
- Engineering offers opportunities for problem-solving, innovation, and making a tangible impact on society. Whether driven by a curiosity for how things work, a passion for technology, or a desire to address global challenges, individuals are motivated to pursue engineering for its intellectual stimulation, job stability, and potential to contribute to advancements that shape the world.
- What is your favorite subject? How many marks did you get?
-  Machine Cutting and Machine Tools are my passion, blending precision engineering with the art of shaping raw materials. Through mastering these tools, I unlock the power to craft innovation with every precise cut and meticulously honed technique,and in this subject i got grade 'B'.
- If you encouter a tough engineering problem, how do you solve it?
- When faced with a tough engineering problem, I typically start by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components. Then, I analyze each component thoroughly, leveraging my knowledge, research skills, and problem-solving techniques to identify potential solutions. Collaboration with peers or mentors can also offer fresh perspectives and insights. Finally, I experiment with different approaches, testing hypotheses and iterating until I find the most effective solution.
- Why did you stick to engineering and not software/programming?
- Engineering resonated with me due to its blend of theoretical concepts and hands-on application, offering a dynamic platform to innovate and solve real-world problems. While software and programming are intriguing, my passion lies in the physical realm, where I can design, build, and optimize tangible systems and structures.
- If you have to do engineering calculations in Python, will be able to do it?
- ust a quick note to mention that I'll be diving into learning Python soonâ€”I'm really excited to explore its potential and delve into the world of programming!
