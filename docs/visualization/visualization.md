CSV file rules:

- The first row is the header row
- For equal X and Y columns defined, the program chooses legend labels based on Y columns by default.
  - If X columsn are to be given, provide the legend labels in settings['legend']['label'] (Add test case for this)
  - Usecase should arise to change this
